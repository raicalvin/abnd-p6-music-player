# Android App: Music Structure App

## Project Information

### Synopsis

This project was developed for my Udacity Android basics Nanodegree Grow With Google Scholarship program. The task for this project was to create a music app where users could navigate through a list of songs, view the 'Now Playing' song, and have an option to purchase a song. The app does not actually play music, but the purpose was to use explicit intents to navigate throughout the app, host a list of available songs in a ListView, use a custom ArrayAdapter to populate list items, and push song information through different activities.

## User Interface

I wanted to implement a dark UI for the list of songs and utilize Material Design icons to communicate familiarity to the user while they navigate through the app. The album cover for each song takes up most of the screen real estate with the playback controls being centered at the bottom of the screen.

## User Experience

The use of Material Design allowed the app to become more familiar for those already accustomed to other Android apps. using icons such as the shopping bag and playback controls introduces an easy and familiar way for people to understand the structure of the app and to be able to get to specific locations easily.

## Issues

- Issue 1 - Transparent backgrounds for the buttons are not correctly being displayed on older versions of Android (API 15 and prior). This does not, however, hinder the app performance.
